- Prim -> Gradually build forest
- Kruskal -> build forests and they gradually come together

- Djikstra is basically a graph search, picking the cheapest path to traverse
  each time
- Predicate is an array which tells you how to get to a vertex's parent
  i.e. from some vertex v, pred[v] tells you which vertex we went from to get to v
